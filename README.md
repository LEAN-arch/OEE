# Factory Simulation Dashboard

This Streamlit app simulates agent-based behavior in a factory environment with supervisors and operators, measuring behavioral variability, team clustering, resilience, and OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness).

## How to run

- Deploy on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) by connecting this repository.
- The app requires Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Use the sidebar to toggle forecast display and download simulation data.

## Features

- Behavioral entropy tracking (SOP adherence, stress response).
- Clustering inertia as a proxy for team dispersion.
- Resilience score based on behavioral recovery.
- OEE components simulation (availability, performance, quality).
- Alerts when behavioral entropy exceeds threshold.
- Interactive visualizations for leadership insights.
